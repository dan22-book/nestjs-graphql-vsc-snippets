## Temporal way of installation

Since I don't feel this is ready to the marketplace you can manually install following this steps.
> Make sure you have installed vsce -> npm install -g @vscode/vsce
- Run vsce package, when prompted type 'y' and hit enter, this will generate a `.vsix` file
- Run `code --install-extension $PATH_TO/*.vsix` 
- If you already had a code instance open run the reload window vscode command `cmd+p -> Reload Window`

### To manually uninstall
- Run `code --uninstall-extension undefined_publisher.nestjs-graphql-snippets`
